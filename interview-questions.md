# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is a part of a statement that allows you to run code based on a certain condition. "True, false, truthy, if else, else if" 

Researched answer: Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is the SYSTEM that allows programmers to keep up with and manage the changes that are made in the code/project. GitHub is the platform in which programmers share the data, code, and collabs.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Comparison operators and logical operators 

Researched answer: Logical values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a number that identifies the position of an element within an array or string. It starts at 0. The value is the actual data INSIDE of the element.

Researched answer: An index is a numerical value that is used to indicate the position of an element in a data structure, such as an array, list, or string. The value, on the other hand, refers to the actual data that is stored at a particular index in a data structure. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: An array stores the same datatype. The values within the array can be changed. They usually store numbers. Strings only contain contain text. There is no numerical value within it. Both strings and arrays are used to collect data.

Researched answer: Strings are similar to arrays with just a few differences. Usually, the array size is fixed, while strings can have a variable number of elements.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is a programming technique where two developers work togther on the same task. The roles are navigating and driving. 

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development practice where two programmers work together on the same computer, collaborating on the same task. The goal is to produce higher-quality code that is more maintainable, reliable, and efficient than what one person could produce alone. Proper pair programming techniques involve the following roles and responsibilities for each person.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
